	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how an algorithm's performance scales with input size. It helps developers evaluate how efficient their code is by analyzing the number of operations performed. Time complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's runtime growth.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to its input size. Like time complexity, it's often expressed using O(n) notation, where n represents the input size. The space requirements can include both auxiliary space and input space, making it crucial for optimizing memory usage in applications.</p>
